## Overview

LeetCode is a versatile collection of algorithmic solutions and utility functions crafted to help developers efficiently solve complex coding challenges. It covers a broad spectrum of problems, from sorting and searching to advanced backtracking and dynamic programming, all optimized for performance.

This project aims to streamline problem-solving workflows by providing reliable, reusable code components. The core features include:

- **Modular Algorithms:** Ready-to-use solutions for common challenges like two-sum, N-Queens, and maximum subarray.
- **Performance-Optimized:** Efficient implementations leveraging binary search, hash maps, and in-place operations.
- **Data Structure Utilities:** Functions for linked lists, trees, matrices, and datastreams to simplify data manipulation.
- **Problem-Solving Focus:** Supports complex tasks such as palindrome detection, subset sums, and matrix traversal.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clear, concise code designed to accelerate development and learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Package Manager:** Conda

---

### Installation

Build leetcode from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krvishabhkumar/Leetcode
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd leetcode
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f conda.yml
    ```

---

### Usage

Run the project with:

```bash
conda activate <your_env_name>
python <your_main_script>.py
````

> Replace `<your_env_name>` with your Conda environment name and `<your_main_script>` with your main Python file name.

---

### Testing

LeetCode uses the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) test framework. Run the test suite with:

```bash
conda activate <your_env_name>
pytest
```
